1. Added frequency notes and delays arrays for super mario bros 1-bit music tone and made changes to set_duty_ratio function so it also changes frequency, by changing the ARR value
2. Not able to produce the full tone, it gets stuck at parts and doesnt continue forward
3. tone only heard in the first while-loop iteration, not in the following ones
4. hmmmmmmm
