## About
This mini-project has been created using the [Libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3.git) library. It has been inspired by [episode 3](https://youtu.be/kHUGY05ImWU?si=Vh5Gr6h10EMrnC-T) of the bare-metal-programming series called 'Blinky to Bootloader' created by [LowBytesProductions](https://github.com/lowbyteproductions), and [this](https://youtu.be/w2Hw4gZW8lg?si=O6G8aiUOVoReguwL) demo-video for the arduino tone function. 
I used this [repository](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs.git) prepared by [Robson Couto](https://github.com/robsoncouto).
